# CORDIC Unit Design using Verilog HDL

## Introduction to CORDIC Algorithm
**CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer)** is an iterative algorithm which allows us to calculate trignometric functions, vector rotations, complex multiplication and division, hyperbolic functions
and many more efficiently in digital hardware.
One of the common applications can be found in **DSP(Digital Signal Processing)** hardwares.

## Iterative Equations of CORDIC

This iterative equations rotates the vector (x,y) by an angle. The Ïƒ is the sign decided by looking at the z[i+1]'s sign. The angle to be rotated is fed into z[0] and after N number of iterations if the results are scaled by the scaling factor K = 0.6072, the rotated vector are obtained.
